"Trump  
01/20/2017  
Inaugural Address  
Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, 
fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank you.  
We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and 
to restore its promise for all of our people.  
Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come.  
We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done.  
Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of 
power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious 
aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.  
Today’s ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely 
transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to another – but we are 
transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American P eople.  
For too long, a small group in our nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while 
the people have borne the cost.  
Washington flourished – but the people did not share in its wealth.  
Politicians prospered – but the jobs left, and the fac tories closed.  
The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country.  
Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and 
while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebra te for struggling families 
all across our land.  
That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it 
belongs to you.  
It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America.   
This is your  day. This is your celebration.  
And this, the United States of America, is your country.  What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is 
controlled by the people.  
January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day  the people became the rulers of this nation 
again.   
The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.  
Everyone is listening to you now.  
You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the 
world has never seen before.  
At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.  
Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good 
jobs for themselves.  
These are th e just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.  
But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in 
poverty in our inner cities; rusted -out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of 
our natio n; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful 
students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many 
lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.  
This American carnag e stops right here and stops right now.  
We are one nation – and their pain is our pain.   Their dreams are our dreams; and their success 
will be our success.   We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.  
The oath of office I take today is an oath  of allegiance to all Americans.  
For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry;  
Subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our 
military;  
We've defended other nation’s border s while refusing to defend our own;  
And spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and 
decay.  
We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has 
disappeared over t he horizon.  One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the 
millions upon millions of American workers left behind.  
The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across 
the entire worl d. 
But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future.  
We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign 
capital, and in every hall of power.  
From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.  
From this moment on, it’s going to be America First.  
Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit 
American workers and American families.  
We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries maki ng our products, stealing 
our companies, and destroying our jobs.   Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.  
I will fight for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you down.  
America will start winning again, winning lik e never before.  
We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders.   We will bring back our 
wealth.   And we will bring back our dreams.  
We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all 
across our wond erful nation.  
We will get our people off of welfare and back to work – rebuilding our country with American 
hands and American labor.  
We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.  
We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with the 
understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.  
We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for 
everyone to follow.  
We will reinforce old  alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world against 
Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth.  At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and 
through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.  
When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.  
The Bible tells us, “how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.”  
We must spea k our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue 
solidarity.  
When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.  
There should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always be protected.  
We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, 
most importantly, we are protected by God.  
Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.  
In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.  
We will no longer accept polit icians who are all talk and no action – constantly complaining but 
never doing anything about it.  
The time for empty talk is over.  
Now arrives the hour of action.  
Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done.   No challenge can match the heart and fight and 
spirit of America.  
We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.  
We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space,  to free the 
Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of 
tomorrow.  
A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.  
It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers wi ll never forget: that whether we are black 
or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious 
freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.  
And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit o r the windswept plains of Nebraska, 
they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are 
infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.  So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large,  from mountain to mountain, and 
from ocean to ocean, hear these words:  
You will never be ignored again.  
Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage 
and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.  
Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.  
We Will Make America Wealthy Again.  
We Will Make America Proud Again.  
We Will Make America Safe Again.  
And, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God 
Bless America.

01/20/2009  
Inaugural Address  
 
I stand here today humbled by the task before us, grateful for the trust you have 
bestowed, mindful of the sacrific es borne by our ancestors. I thank President Bush for 
his service to our nation, as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown 
throughout this transition . 
Forty -four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been 
spoken during  rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so 
often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, 
America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high 
office, but beca use We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our 
forbearers, and true to our founding documents . 
So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans . 
That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood. Our nation is at war, against 
a far-reaching network of violence and hatred. Our economy is badly weakened, a 
consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some, but also our collective 
failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age. Homes have bee n 
lost; jobs shed; businesses shuttered. Our health care is too costly; our schools fail too 
many; and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen 
our adversaries and threaten our planet . 
These are the indicators of crisis, subj ect to data and statistics. Less measurable but no 
less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land —a nagging fear that 
America's decline is inevitable, and that the next generation must lower its sights . 
Today I say to you that the challenges we f ace are real. They are serious and they are 
many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, 
America —they will be met . 
On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over 
conflict and discord . 
On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, 
the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our 
politics . 
We remain a young nation, but in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set 
aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our 
better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: the God -given promise that all are equal, all are free, and  all 
deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness . 
In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a 
given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short -cuts or settling for 
less. It has not bee n the path for the faint -hearted —for those who prefer leisure over 
work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk -takers, 
the doers, the makers of things —some celebrated but more often men and women 
obscure in their labor , who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards 
prosperity and freedom . 
For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in 
search of a new life . 
For us, they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West; endured the lash  of the whip 
and plowed the hard earth . 
For us, they fought and died, in places like Concord and Gettysburg; Normandy and 
Khe Sahn . 
Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their 
hands were raw so that we might live a bet ter life. They saw America as bigger than 
the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth 
or faction . 
This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful 
nation on Earth. Our workers are n o less productive than when this crisis began. Our 
minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last 
week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of 
standing pat, of protecting narrow  interests and putting off unpleasant decisions —that 
time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, 
and begin again the work of remaking America . 
For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the eco nomy calls for 
action, bold and swift, and we will act —not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new 
foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and 
digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will resto re science to 
its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and 
lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and 
run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges an d universities to 
meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. And all this we will do . 
Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions —who suggest that our 
system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they hav e 
forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve 
when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage . What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them —that 
the stale politi cal arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. The 
question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small, but 
whether it works —whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can 
afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move 
forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the 
public's dollars will be held to account —to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do 
our business in the light o f day —because only then can we restore the vital trust 
between a people and their government . 
Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill. Its power to 
generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but this crisis has rem inded us that 
without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control —and that a nation cannot 
prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has 
always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product, but on the  reach 
of our prosperity; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart —not out 
of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good . 
As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our 
ideals. Our  Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a 
charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood 
of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for 
expedience 's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching 
today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know 
that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a 
future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more . 
Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with 
missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. They 
understood that our power alone cannot protect  us, nor does it entitle us to do as we 
please. Instead, they knew that our power grows through its prudent use; our security 
emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering 
qualities of humility and restraint . 
We are the k eepers of this legacy. Guided by these principles once more, we can meet 
those new threats that demand even greater effort —even greater cooperation and 
understanding between nations. We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, 
and forge a hard -earned peace in Afghanistan. With old friends and former foes, we 
will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the specter of a warming 
planet. We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and 
for those wh o seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering 
innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you . 
For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weak ness. We are a 
nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non -believers. We are shaped 
by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we 
have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark 
chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall 
someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows 
smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must pla y its role 
in ushering in a new era of peace . 
To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and 
mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame 
their society's ills on the West, know that your  people will judge you on what you can 
build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and 
deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but 
that we will extend a hand if you are willing to  unclench your fist . 
To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms 
flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds. 
And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we  can no longer 
afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's 
resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change 
with it . 
As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude 
those brave Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far -off deserts and distant 
mountains. They have something to tell us today, just as the fallen heroes who lie in 
Arlington whisper through the ages. We honor them not only because they are 
guardians of our liberty, but because they embody the spirit of service; a willingness 
to find meaning in something greater than themselves. And yet, at this moment —a 
moment that will define a generation —it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us  
all. 
For as much as government can do and must do, it is ultimately the faith and 
determination of the American people upon which this nation relies. It is the kindness 
to take in a stranger when the levees break, the selflessness of workers who would 
rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest 
hours. It is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke, but also a 
parent's willingness to nurture a child, that finally decides our fate . 
Our chal lenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. 
But those values upon which our success depends —hard work and honesty, courage 
and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism —these things are old. These things are true . They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our 
history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. What is required of us now 
is a new era of responsibility —a recognition, on the part of every American, that we 
have duties to ourselves , our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly 
accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying 
to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task . 
This is the price and the promise of citizenship . 
This is the source of our confidence —the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an 
uncertain destiny . 
This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed —why men and women and children 
of every race and every faith can join in  celebration across this magnificent mall, and 
why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a 
local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath . 
So let us mark this day with remembrance, of who we are an d how far we have 
traveled. In the year of America's birth, in the coldest of months, a small band of 
patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river. The capital was 
abandoned. The enemy was advancing. The snow was stained with blood. At  a 
moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt, the father of our 
nation ordered these words be read to the people : 
""Let it be told to the future world...that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope 
and virtue could survive...that the  city and the country, alarmed at one common 
danger, came forth to meet [it]. "" 
America. In the face of our common dangers, in this winter of our hardship, let us 
remember these timeless words. With hope and virtue, let us brave once more the icy 
currents, and endure what storms may come. Let it be said by our children's children 
that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end, that we did not turn back 
nor did we falter; and with eyes fixed on the horizon and God's grace upon us, we 
carried fort h that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations . 
Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America .

01/20/2001  
Inaugural Address  
 
President Clinton, distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, the peaceful transfer of 
authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath, w e affirm 
old traditions and make new beginnings . 
As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation . 
And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with 
grace . 
I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so  many of America's leaders have 
come before me, and so many will follow . 
We have a place, all of us, in a long story —a story we continue, but whose end we 
will not see. It is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the 
old, a story o f a slave -holding society that became a servant of freedom, the story of a 
power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer . 
It is the American story —a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the 
generation s by grand and enduring ideals . 
The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that everyone belongs, 
that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born . 
Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in  our laws. And though 
our nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other 
course . 
Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a 
rock in a raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root  in many nations . 
Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our 
humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. And even 
after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel . 
While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our 
own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and 
hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences 
run so dee p, it seems we share a continent, but not a country . 
We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our unity, our union, is the serious 
work of leaders and citizens in every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will 
work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity . 
I know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His image . 
And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward . 
America has never been united by blood or bi rth or soil. We are bound by ideals that 
move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it 
means to be citizens. Every child must be taught these principles. Every citizen must 
uphold them. And every immigrant, by embracing t hese ideals, makes our country 
more, not less, American . 
Today, we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility, 
courage, compassion and character . 
America, at its best, matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civi lity. A 
civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and 
forgiveness . 
Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of 
peace, the stakes of our debates appear small . 
But the stakes for America  are never small. If our country does not lead the cause of 
freedom, it will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge 
and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If we permit our 
economy to drift and d ecline, the vulnerable will suffer most . 
We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is the 
determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this 
commitment, if we keep it, is a way to shared a ccomplishment . 
America, at its best, is also courageous . 
Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defending 
common dangers defined our common good. Now we must choose if the example of 
our fathers and mothers will inspire us  or condemn us. We must show courage in a 
time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future 
generations . 
Together, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy claim more 
young lives . 
We will reform Social Secu rity and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we 
have the power to prevent. And we will reduce taxes, to recover the momentum of our 
economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans . 
We will build our defenses beyond challenge, le st weakness invite challenge . 
We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new 
horrors . 
The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake: America remains 
engaged in the world by history and by choice, shaping a  balance of power that favors 
freedom. We will defend our allies and our interests. We will show purpose without arrogance. We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength. And to all 
nations, we will speak for the values that gave our nati on birth . 
America, at its best, is compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know 
that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise . 
And whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault. 
Aban donment and abuse are not acts of God, they are failures of love . 
And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and 
order in our souls . 
Where there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not strangers, they are 
citizens, not problems, but priorities. And all of us are diminished when any are 
hopeless . 
Government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health, for civil 
rights and common schools. Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a 
government . 
And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a 
pastor's prayer. Church and charity, synagogue and mosque lend our communities 
their humanity, and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws . 
Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who 
do. 
And I can pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road 
to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side . 
America, at its best, is a place w here personal responsibility is valued and expected . 
Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to conscience. 
And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment. We find the fullness of 
life not only in options, but in commitments. And we find that children and 
community are the commitments that set us free . 
Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and 
basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency which give direct ion to our 
freedom . 
Sometimes in life we are called to do great things. But as a saint of our times has said, 
every day we are called to do small things with great love. The most important tasks 
of a democracy are done by everyone . 
I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to 
pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to 
call for responsibility and try to live it as well . 
In all these ways, I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times . 
What you do is as important as anything government does. I ask you to seek a 
common good beyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against easy attacks; to serve your n ation, beginning with your neighbor. I ask you to be citizens: citizens, not 
spectators; citizens, not subjects; responsible citizens, building communities of service 
and a nation of character . 
Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we b elieve in ourselves, 
but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves. When this spirit of citizenship is 
missing, no government program can replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong 
can stand against it . 
After the Declaration of Independence was signe d, Virginia statesman John Page 
wrote to Thomas Jefferson: ""We know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the 
strong. Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm? "" 
Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his in auguration. The years and 
changes accumulate. But the themes of this day he would know: our nation's grand 
story of courage and its simple dream of dignity . 
We are not this story's author, who fills time and eternity with his purpose. Yet his 
purpose is ac hieved in our duty, and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another . 
Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today, to make 
our country more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life . 
This work co ntinues. This story goes on. And an angel still rides in the whirlwind and 
directs this storm . 
God bless you all, and God bless America .

"Biden  
01/20/2021  
Inaugural Address  
Chief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader 
McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans.  
This is America’s day.  
This is democracy’s day.  
A day of history and hope.  
Of renewal and r esolve.  
Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the 
challenge.  
Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy.  
The will of the people has been heard and the will of t he people has been heeded.  
We have learned again that democracy is precious.  
Democracy is fragile.  
And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.  
So now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this Capitol’s 
very found ation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the 
peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.  
We look ahead in our uniquely American way – restless, bold, optimistic – and set our sights on 
the nation we  know we can be and we must be.  
I thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here.  
I thank them from the bottom of my heart.  
You know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation.  
As does President Carter, who I spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom 
we salute for his lifetime of service.  I have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took — an oath first sworn by George 
Washington.  
But the American story depends not on any one of us, not o n some of us, but on all of us.  
On “We the People” who seek a more perfect Union.  
This is a great nation and we are a good people.  
Over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we 
still have far to go.  
We will p ress forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and 
possibility.  
Much to repair.  
Much to restore.  
Much to heal.  
Much to build.  
And much to gain.  
Few periods in our nation’s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we’re in 
now.  
A once -in-a-century virus silently stalks the country.  
It’s taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II.  
Millions of jobs have  been lost.  
Hundreds of thousands of businesses closed.  
A cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will 
be deferred no longer.  
A cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can’t be any more d esperate or any 
more clear.  
And now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must 
confront and we will defeat.  To overcome these challenges – to restore the soul and to secure the future of America – requires 
more than wo rds. 
It requires that most elusive of things in a democracy:  
Unity.  
Unity.  
In another January in Washington, on New Year’s Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the 
Emancipation Proclamation.  
When he put pen to paper, the President said, “If my name ever goes d own into history it will be 
for this act and my whole soul is in it.”  
My whole soul is in it.  
Today, on this January day, my whole soul is in this:  
Bringing America together.  
Uniting our people.  
And uniting our nation.  
I ask every American to join me in th is cause.  
Uniting to fight the common foes we face:  
Anger, resentment, hatred.  
Extremism, lawlessness, violence.  
Disease, joblessness, hopelessness.  
With unity we can do great things. Important things.  
We can right wrongs.  
We can put people to work in good  jobs.  
We can teach our children in safe schools.  
We can overcome this deadly virus.  We can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health car e 
secure for all.  
We can deliver racial justice.  
We can make America, once again, the leading force for good in the world.  
I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy.  
I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real.  
But I also know they are not new.  
Our history has been  a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal 
and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart.  
The battle is perennial.  
Victory is never assured.  
Through the Civil War, the G reat Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and 
setbacks, our “better angels” have always prevailed.  
In each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward.  
And, we can do so now.  
History, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity.  
We can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors.  
We can treat each other with dignity and respect.  
We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature.  
For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury.  
No progress, only exhausting outrage.  
No nation, only a state of chaos.  
This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward.  
And, we must meet this moment as the United States of America.  
If we do that, I guarantee you, we will not fail.  We have never, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together.  
And so today, at this time and in this place, let us start afresh.  
All of us.  
Let us listen to one another.  
Hear one another . 
See one another.  
Show respect to one another.  
Politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path.  
Every disagreement doesn’t have to be a cause for total war.  
And, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.  
My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this.  
America has to be better than this.  
And, I believe America is better than this.  
Just look around.  
Here we stand, in the shadow of a Capitol dome that was completed amid the Civil War, when 
the Union it self hung in the balance.  
Yet we endured and we prevailed.  
Here we stand looking out to the great Mall where Dr. King spoke of his dream.  
Here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protestors tried to block 
brave women from march ing for the right to vote.  
Today, we mark the swearing -in of the first woman in American history elected to national office 
– Vice President Kamala Harris.  
Don’t tell me things can’t change.  
Here we stand across the Potomac from Arlington National Cemetery , where heroes who gave 
the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace.  And here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the 
will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive us from thi s sacred ground.  
That did not happen.  
It will never happen.  
Not today.  
Not tomorrow.  
Not ever.  
To all those who supported our campaign I am humbled by the faith you have placed in us.  
To all those who did not support us, let me say this: Hear me out as we move forward. Take a 
measure of me and my heart.  
And if you still disagree, so be it.  
That’s democracy. That’s America. The right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our 
Republic, is perhaps our nation’s greatest strength.  
Yet hear me clearly: D isagreement must not lead to disunion.  
And I pledge this to you: I will be a President for all Americans.  
I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did.  
Many centuries ago, Saint Augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude 
defined by the common objects of their love.  
What are the common objects we love that define us as Americans?  
I think I know.  
Opportunity.  
Security.  
Liberty.  
Dignity. 
Respect.  Honor.  
And, yes, the truth.  
Recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson.  
There is truth and there are lies.  
Lies told for power and for profit.  
And each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especial ly as leaders 
– leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation — to defend the 
truth and to defeat the lies.  
I understand that many Americans view the future with some fear and trepidation.  
I understand they worry about their job s, about taking care of their families, about what comes 
next.  
I get it.  
But the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who 
don’t look like you do, or worship the way you do, or don’t get their news from the sam e sources 
you do.  
We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus 
liberal.  
We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts.  
If we show a little tolerance and humility.  
If we’re willing to  stand in the other person’s shoes just for a moment . 
Because here is the thing about life: There is no accounting for what fate will deal you.  
There are some days when we need a hand.  
There are other days when we’re called on to lend one.  
That is how we m ust be with one another.  
And, if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future.  
My fellow Americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each other.  
We will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter.  We are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus.  
We must set aside the politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation.  
I promise you this: as the Bi ble says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the 
morning.  
We will get through this, together  
The world is watching today.  
So here is my message to those beyond our borders: America has been tested and we have come 
out stronger for it.  
We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again.  
Not to meet yesterday’s challenges, but today’s and tomorrow’s.  
We will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example.  
We will be a strong and trusted partner for peac e, progress, and security.  
We have been through so much in this nation.  
And, in my first act as President, I would like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer 
to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic.  
To those 400,000 fellow  Americans – mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and 
daughters, friends, neighbors, and co -workers.  
We will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be.  
Let us say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our 
country.  
Amen.  
This is a time of testing.  
We face an attack on democracy and on truth.  
A raging virus.  
Growing inequity.  
The sting of systemic racism.  A climate in crisis.  
America’s role in the world.  
Any one of these wo uld be enough to challenge us in profound ways.  
But the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilities.  
Now we must step up.  
All of us.  
It is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do.  
And, this is certain.  
We will be judged, you and I, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era.  
Will we rise to the occasion?  
Will we master this rare and difficult hour?  
Will we meet our oblig ations and pass along a new and better world for our children?  
I believe we must and I believe we will.  
And when we do, we will write the next chapter in the American story.  
It’s a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me.  
It’s c alled “American Anthem” and there is one verse stands out for me:  
“The work and prayer s 
of centuries have brought us to this da y 
What shall be our legacy ? 
What will our children say? … 
Let me know in my hear t 
When my days are throug h 
Americ a 
Americ a 
I gave my best to you.”  
Let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nation.  
If we do this then when our days are through our children and our children’s children will say of 
us they gave their best.  They did their duty.  
They healed a broken land. 
My fellow Americans, I close today where I began, with a sacred oath.  
Before God and all of you I give you my word.  
I will always level with you.  
I will defend the Constitution.  
I will defend our democracy.  
I will defend America.  
I will give my all i n your service thinking not of power, but of possibilities.  
Not of personal interest, but of the public good.  
And together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear.  
Of unity, not division.  
Of light, not darkness.  
An American story of decency and  dignity.  
Of love and of healing.  
Of greatness and of goodness.  
May this be the story that guides us.  
The story that inspires us.  
The story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history.  
We met the moment.  
That democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrived.  
That our America secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to th e world.  
That is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow.  
So, with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time.  Sustained by faith.  
Driven by conviction.  
And, devoted to one another and to this country we love with all our hearts.  
May God bless America and may God protect our troops.  
Thank you, America.
