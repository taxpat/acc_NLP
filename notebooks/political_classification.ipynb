You will first be tasked with selecting a labeled text dataset to train a supervised classifier, then you will apply it to your dataset from Unit 1.\n","\n","Next, you will find a pretrained supervised model from Hugging Face, which has a larger collection of pretrained document classification and sentiment analysis models. You will investigate the results of the model you trained against the pretrained model and compare their performances. This will help you decide how you might incorporate some form of either document classification or sentiment analysis into your final product.\n","\n","**General breakdown of steps**:\n","\n","\n","1.   Select a labeled dataset to perform document classification or sentiment analysis\n","2.   Train at least two different models on the dataset, compare performance - If in the 6420 section, select at least 2 different models AND perform at least two steps of parameter tuning\n","3.   Apply the classification model to your dataset from Unit 1\n","4.   Examine results, speak to how well it appears to perform\n","5.   Apply a pretrained transformer model to your dataset from Unit 1\n","6.   Examine results, speak to how well it appears to perform\n","7.   Compare and contrast your trained model vs the pretrained model\n","\n","**Some suggested datasets for document classification**:\n","\n","\n","*   Brown Corpus -- accesible through NLTK\n","*   20 News Groups -- accessible through scikit learn\n","*   [Yelp Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset)\n","\n","**Some suggetsed datasets for sentiment analysis**:\n","\n","*   [IMDB movie reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)\n","*   [Sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)\n","*   Yelp Reviews Dataset - linked above\n","\n","You are by no means limited to these datasets, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) has lots of datasets available for document classification and sentiment analysis, so you may find something more relevant to your dataset there.
